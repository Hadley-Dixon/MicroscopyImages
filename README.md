# MicroscopyImages
Final Project MATH 373

## Project Description
Compete in the "Counting cells in microscopy imagesLinks to an external site." Kaggle contest that I've created for our class. You should implement a U-Net in PyTorch and train it using the data provided by the Kaggle contest. Use your trained U-Net to compete in the Kaggle competition. Write a short report telling the story of your work on this contest. 

The original famous paper from 2015 which introduced the U-Net architecture can be found in my project writeup.
